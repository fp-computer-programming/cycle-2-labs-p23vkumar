#1. Create a Python file named lab_2-2.py

#2. Set a equal to 3 and b equal to a

a = 3
b = a

#3. Print the value of b and the value of a.

print(b)
print(a)

#4. What is the value of each variable and why? (Answer as a comment)

#The value of a is 3 and the value b is 3 because since b = a, using the transitive propoerty of congruence, since a = 3, b = 3

#5. Set a equal to 7.

a = 7

#6. Print the value of a and the value of b

print(a)
print(b)

#7. What is the value of each variable and why? (Answer as a comment)

# The value of a is 7 and the value of b is 3 because a is a new input and therefore produces a different value but the value of b still results in the original output of 3  of the original condition
