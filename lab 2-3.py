#1. Create a Python file named lab_2-3.py

#2. Set a equal to 2. 
# Using the type() function, print the type of variable a

a = 2
print(type(a))

#3. Change the type of a to a float using a = float(a). What is the result of printing type(a) now?

a = float(a)
print(a)

# The result of the float of the type function is 2.0

#4. Convert a to a string. Check its type with a print statement. What has changed?

a = str(a)
print(a)

# Nothing has changed, the value is still 2.0 similar to its float

#5. Convert a to a Boolean. Print the result of a == 2. What is the result? Why? (Answer as a comment)

a = bool(a)
print(a)
print( a == 2)

#The result is it is a false value because
