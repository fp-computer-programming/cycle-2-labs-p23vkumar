#1. Create a python file named lab_2-4.py
#2. Translate the following expression into a line of code that can be
#solved in Python:
#3. Set the variables equal to the following values to see if you 
# formatted the equation correctly (The result should be 31)
#4. Revise your code as needed. 

#Define the variables before setting up the command of pemdas
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
x = 2
y = 5

#Seperate Functions 
y1 = (3 + 4*x)/5
print(y1)
y2 = (10*(y-5)*(a+b+c)**2)/2
print(y2)
x1 = 4/x**2
print(x1)
x2 = (9+x)/y
print(x2)
x3 = 9 * (x1 + x2)
print(x3)

#Add them all up
z4 = y1 - y2 + x3
print(z4)
